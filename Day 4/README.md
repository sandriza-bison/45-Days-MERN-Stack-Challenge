# Hot-Pink Skills Array Challenge

A vibrant and interactive project demonstrating JavaScript array manipulation and DOM updates.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Dynamic Skills Array:** Skills with proficiency stored in a JavaScript array.
- **Hot-Pink Theme:** Bold gradients, borders, and hover effects for a visually appealing design.
- **Animated Fade-In:** Skills appear with a smooth staggered animation.
- **Interactive Tooltips:** Hover over each skill to see its proficiency level.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on desktop and mobile devices.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (hot-pink theme, hover effects, animations)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, array mapping)

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
1. Skills are stored in a JavaScript array with `name`, `proficiency`, and `emoji`.  
2. The array is mapped dynamically to `<li>` elements inside a `<ul>`.  
3. Each `<li>` fades in sequentially for a lively effect.  
4. Hovering over a skill displays a tooltip showing the proficiency.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
- Practiced **DOM manipulation** using JavaScript.  
- Learned **hover tooltips** and staggered animations.  
- Explored **modern UI design** using colors, borders, and padding.  
- Strengthened foundations for **interactive front-end development**.
